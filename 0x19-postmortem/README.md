Postmortem: April 15, 2024 web stack crashed

Issue Summary:

    Time 2024 February 15, 09:00 am to 2024 February 15, 12:00 pm (UTC)
    Impact: The outage affected our core web applications, causing intermittent connection issues and slow response times for users. About 70% of our users experienced interruptions during this period.
    Root cause: The root cause was identified as a poorly configured load balancer, which failed to evenly distribute traffic between backend servers, resulting in oversampling and degraded performance

Schedule:

    09:00 AM (UTC): Problem detected as monitoring warnings indicate increased latency and error rates.
    09:15 AM: Engineering team alerted to investigate an issue.
    09:30 AM: The first review focused on backend server health and database performance.
    09:45 AM: Scaled up resources assumes database overload as a possible cause.
    10:00 am: No progress noted; For discrepancies, the load balancing system was reviewed.
    10:30 AM: misconfigured load balancer identified as root cause.
    10:45 a.m.: The issue escalated to engineering team officials for immediate resolution.
    11:30 AM: Corrected the load balancer settings to evenly distribute traffic.
    12:00 PM: Fully restored service and normal response time.

Root Causes and Solutions:

The problem was caused by an improperly configured load balancer, which caused the traffic to be unequally distributed among the backend servers. This caused overloading in a few cases, which degraded performance. The issue was resolved by adjusting the load balancing policy to distribute traffic equally across all backend servers.

Corrective and preventive measures:

    Load Balancer Configuration Review: Use regular load balancer configuration reviews
    to ensure proper traffic distribution.
    Automatic health checks: Set up automatic health checks to detect and alert you to load balance malconfiguration in real time.
    Redundancy and Scalability: Increase the redundancy and scalability of the backend server to reduce the impact of uneven traffic distribution.
    Incident response training: Provide additional training to technical teams on incident response procedures and troubleshooting techniques.

conclusion:

On April 15, 2024, the network stack was interrupted by a misconfigured load balancer, giving users late connection issues and slow response times While the root cause was quickly identified and repaired, service was restored within three hours. Going forward, strategic measures will be used to prevent similar incidents and increase the reliability of our network
