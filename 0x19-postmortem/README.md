Postmortem: April 15, 2024 web stack crashed

Issue Summary:

	Time 2024 February 15, 09:00 am to 2024 February 15, 12:00 pm (UTC)
	Impact: Get in touch, the website went on a rollercoaster! Between 9am and 12pm, our main web application ground to a halt, leaving users stranded in a digital desert. Almost 70% of our users are left scrolling at their screens in frustration.
	Root cause: Picture this: a load balancer with a cognitive disorder. Couldn’t decide which backend server to send traffic to, so favorites were created, some servers were overloaded and others left digital thumbs twiddling.

Schedule:

	09:00 am (UTC): Disaster! Surveillance warnings screamed louder than a teenager at a rock concert.
	09:15 AM: Our brave technical team leapt into action ready to do battle with the digital monsters.
	09:30 AM: The initial investigation was like a discovery in a digital haystack. Backend servers were grilled, databases were queried.
	09:45 AM: We thought we’d found the villain: abuse database. Things were thrown at it like confetti at a party.
	10:00 am - Unfortunately, no progress! We stared at the weight balance, hoping for an answer.
	10:30 a.m.: Eureka! The weightlifter pleaded guilty. Playing favorites with our servers, it was out of sync.
	10:45 p.m.: SOS to Senior Engineering Squadron, needing cavalry.
	11:30 AM: The load balancer has been relearned and retuned, and the traffic now flows like a well-oiled machine.
	12:00 p.m.: Silence was restored to the digital realm and users rejoiced as the website came back to life.\

Root Causes and Solutions:

The culprit behind the mayhem is a weight-better who was suffering from an identity crisis. By reconfiguring traffic for more even distribution, we restored unity to the digital kingdom.

Corrective and preventive measures:

	Load Balancer Therapy: Regular meetings designed to keep the load balancer’s ego in check and ensure proper traffic allocation.
	Automated sanity checks: Used automated checks to catch load-balancing shenanigans before they wreak havoc.
	Redundancy reinforcement: Strengthen backend server redundancy to cope with traffic changes without breaking any sweat.
	Emergency response drills: Train teams in the art of digital firefighting, so they are prepared to handle any future crisis like professionals.

conclusion:

The web stack outage on April 15, 2024 is a rollercoaster ride of digital drama, with a poorly configured load balancer playing the villain. With quick action and comedy, we restored order to the chaos and emerged stronger than before. As we ride off into the digital sunset, we are equipped with the knowledge and readiness to meet any challenges the web throws our way.
